## Ginny Thomas

I am an ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer and a recent graduate of Makers Academy 16 week software developer bootcamp. I have spent the past 15 years working in healthcare.  I started as a nurses aid to get hospital experience on my way to becoming a registered nurse.  I went on to become a clinical director of a home (community) health agency while earning my Masters Degree in Nursing - Family Nurse Practitioner from Grand Canyon University. Over the past two years I have become a Aesthetic Nurse Specialist while living in the UK.  I have also opened a craft butcher shop in Cambridge where I am a director and run the financial aspects of the company.  Tech and software development excites me, because like nursing, there are worlds of possibilities.  I love that software development is needed everywhere and I can pursue different personal passions and interests within my career.
