## About Me
I am an ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer and a recent graduate of Makers Academy 16 week software developer bootcamp. I have spent the past 15 years working in healthcare.  I started as a nurses aid to get hospital experience on my way to becoming a registered nurse.  I went on to become a clinical director of a home (community) health agency while earning my Masters Degree in Nursing - Family Nurse Practitioner from Grand Canyon University. Over the past two years I have become a Aesthetic Nurse Specialist while living in the UK.  I have also opened a craft butcher shop in Cambridge where I am a director and run the financial aspects of the company.  Tech and software development excites me, because like nursing, there are worlds of possibilities.  I love that software development is needed everywhere and I can pursue different personal passions and interests within my career.

## Skills

### Tech Skills
- Ruby (Rails, Sinatra, Capybara, RSpec)
- JavaScript (Node, React, Express, Jest)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, TablePlus, DataGrip)
- HTML, CSS
- GitHub, Git, Command-line
- IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine)

#### Self-Drive

- I have demonstrated self-drive throughout my nursing career, transitioning from an aide, to a nurse, to a director, and to an advance practice nurse.
- It was evident when I moved to the UK and started a small business to help contribute to society in a meaningful way, it was evident when I transitioned to an aesthetic nurse, and it was evident when I transitioned my career from nursing to software development.  
- Throughout Makers Academy I continued to use self drive to increase my knowledge of testing and programming languages during unscheduled time.  
- Post Makers Academy I have signed up and started an Introduction to Object Oriented Programming with Java program from Georgia Tech

#### Collaborative Spirit

I have demonstrated a Collaborative Spirit throughout all my work and learning experiences through the many team projects I have completed.  In my last two clinic nursing roles I collaborated with other team members and company owners to help make processes run smoother and improve patient satisfaction.  In both roles I also showed Active Ownership and the Capgemini company value of Boldness, in improving processes by taking on the task and responsibility of working with the software system in place to get the clinics out of the status quo and onto digital records. 

#### Ownership & Leadership

I am placing ownership and leadership together as for me, they often occur at the same time.  I strive for the best, in myself and others.  This flows into group projects, where I take on ownership of it to help it be something I am proud of.  While in education programs, projects have a specific due date and tasks.  In order to make the most of the time we have been given, I often step-up and take the lead to get things going.  In the Makers program, for two of the three group projects, I stepped up to get a project started by taking ownership of the team documents needed. I also provided information specific to the scrum process and asked the team to review it so that we could discuss the Scrum Master role and have our stand ups and retros follow the recommendations.  In both cases I empowered someone else to take on the Scrum Master role.
