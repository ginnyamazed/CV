## About Me
I am an ambitious Full-Stack Junior Developer and a recent graduate of Makers Academy 16 week software developer bootcamp. I have spent the past 15 years working in healthcare. I know what it's like to start at the beginning as an apprentice, gaining experience and knowledge as I go. Over the past two years I have become a Aesthetic Nurse Specialist while living in the UK.  I have also opened a craft butcher shop in Cambridge where I am a director and run the financial aspects of the company.  This has given me experience in the start up world.  It also reinforced my desire to have a career that can take me anywhere and not tie me down to one location.  Tech and software development excites me, because like nursing, there are worlds of possibilities.  I love that software development is needed everywhere and I can pursue different personal passions and interests within my career.

## Skills

#### Self-Motivated, Fast Starter

I have focused on my drive for continual self improvement throughout my nursing career, transitioning from an aide, to a nurse, to a director, all the way to an advance practice nurse (GP).  This has continued throughout and after Maker's Academy where I dove into working with Ruby and JavaScript, and am now working my way through a Georgia Tech program on Object Oriented Programming with Java.  

#### Collaborative Spirit

I have demonstrated a Collaborative Spirit throughout all my work and learning experiences through the many team projects I have completed.  In my last two clinic nursing roles I collaborated with other team members and company owners to help make processes run smoother and improve patient satisfaction.  In both roles I also showed Active Ownership and Boldness, in improving processes by taking on the task and responsibility of working with the software system in place to get the clinics out of the status quo and onto digital records. 

#### Ownership & Leadership

I am placing ownership and leadership together as I believe leadership will always fall to strong owners. I have found that by being a strong owner, I often provide an example that others want to follow.  This is the manifestation of my belief that the best leadership is truly servant leadership, where I strive to bring out the best in myself and others.  This flows into group projects, where I often take on ownership of the project in the planning stage.  I start by seeking to understand the requirements of what I'm building from the point of view of it's customer or user.  In the Makers program, for two of the three group projects, I aligned my team to get a project started by taking ownership of the team documents needed. I also kickstarted our scrum process so that we could discuss the Scrum Master role and have our stand ups and retros follow the recommendations.  In both cases I encouraged another team member to take on the Scrum Master role so that they could experience team leadership.
